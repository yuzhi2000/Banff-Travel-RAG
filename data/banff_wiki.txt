For the Scottish town that Banff was named after, see Banff (Scotland)
The town of Banff in Banff National Park, in the Canadian Rockies, is the larger of the two populated areas in Banff National Park, about an hour and a half drive west of Calgary and four hours south of Jasper. Banff is part of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks UNESCO World Heritage Site. Like many mountain towns, Banff has a very different character in winter and summer. There is a decent selection of bars and restaurants but predictably a few too many souvenir shops and boutiques. European travellers will especially welcome the sidewalks that facilitate exploration of the town on foot.
Understand
Banff is a tourist town full of visitors and seasonal workers from across Canada and around the world. It is a convenient base for seeing some spectacular scenery with little effort. However, with convenience comes crowds. Banff Avenue can be very busy on summer afternoons and evenings, but it is a great place to stay for any length of time. There are a wide variety of restaurants and clubs and plenty of tours and activities to keep you busy. Staying in Banff during the winter gives easy access to the nearby ski areas of Norquay, Sunshine Village, and Lake Louise.
The area was named Banff in 1884 by George Stephen, president of the Canadian Pacific Railway, recalling his birthplace in Banff, Scotland.
Climate
At an elevation of 1400m above sea level and surrounded by mountains, the climate is subarctic. Banff has experienced snowfall even during the summer months. With daily mean temperatures of +15°C in the summer and -8°C in the winter, the climate is very similar to northern Scandinavia.
Get in
By plane
The park is easily accessible for international travellers via Calgary International Airport, which has international scheduled and charter flights. The Banff Airporter ($63.99 one way) and the Brewster Airport Express ($69.99 one way) run regular scheduled trips between the airport and Banff several times daily.
Alternatively, On It transit provides a direct Calgary downtown to Banff central service for a flat rate of $10. It's less convenient than the direct shuttles, as getting from the airport to downtown requires either an expense taxi or an hour-long trip on public transit.
By car
From Calgary, take the Highway 1 (Trans-Canada Highway) west. The first exit to Banff is about an hour and a half from the airport.
The Icefields Parkway (Highway 93) is a scenic drive from Jasper.
Parking can be tricky, but the five-storey Bear Street Parkade near downtown is free. Look for it in the 100 block of Bear Street, one block west of Banff Avenue. The Bear Street Parkade also has an EV charging station. The Town of Banff website has parking maps.

Spas
Banff National Park was established to protect and promote the natural hot springs at the Cave & Basin (now Cave & Basin National Historic Site).

Winter
Skiing and snowboarding
Banff National Park is home to three ski areas, all within easy drive of the Banff townsite. Driving to the hill is not strictly required, as ski shuttles have stops convenient to most hotels. They will take you to the mountain of your choice and back again. Shuttle buses are included in the price of some ski passes, or you may have to pay a fare ($15).
Of the three Banff National Park ski areas, only Sunshine Village has ski-in ski-out accommodations. However, access to Sunshine is solely through their gondola. The gondola stops running Sa-Th at 4PM, and F at 10PM. Sunshine is a village in name only; there are very few activities there after the ski lifts shut down for the day. Most skiers stay in the town of Banff or the village of Lake Louise.
The ski season in Banff runs from early November to mid-April. The final day of skiing at Sunshine Village is always on Victoria Day, in late May.
12 Norquay, End of Mount Norquay Scenic Drive, ☏ +1 403-762-4421. The closest mountain to the Banff townsite, and it is much used by the locals. It is unique in the area because you can pay for skiing by the hour, and night skiing is available on Fridays and Saturdays. There is a tube park for non-skiers (and non-boarders.) The ski season is a little shorter at Norquay, because it is at a lower altitude than Sunshine and Lake Louise, and snowfall is less consistent. The trails here lean more towards steep and difficult, although there is still plenty of easy terrain. Giv'er Grandi (formerly Excalibur, accessed via Mystic Express lift) is North America's steepest groomed piste. The lodge is not much good for breakfast; lunch and beer on the deck can't be beat however! $61 for full-day adult ticket. OSM directions edit
13 Sunshine Village, End of Sunshine Road, ☏ +1 403-705-4000, toll-free: +1-877-542-2633. 20 minutes west of the Banff townsite. It also receives more snow than the other two resorts and benefits from a higher elevation and a generally longer ski season. All natural snow, no snow-making. Also fantastic scenery. It is the only resort of the three to have on-hill accommodation. Buffet breakfast served in the lodge at the bottom of the gondola - not much else until lunchtime once you get to the top. $85 full-day adult ticket. OSM directions edit
See also Lake Louise Ski Resort
All the ski hills are busier on the weekends. Lake Louise tends to get icy if it hasn't snowed in a while, but with fresh snow is hard to beat. Sunshine Village has been giving them some competition with their new terrain and improvements however. Especially in the early season, pay attention to how many runs are open and how much recent snow has been received in the snow reports - they are better indications of the conditions than the generic conditions ratings given by the hills (the conditions are always at least 'good' according to their ratings). If you only have a few hours and want to ski where the locals ski check out Ski Norquay, it has nice long open runs with great views of the town.
Lift passes
If you arrive before December 31 and you intend to ski at least 3 days at Sunshine Village, or a combination of three days at Sunshine and at Marmot Basin in Jasper, consider buying a Sunshine-Marmot card. The card costs about the same price as one lift ticket. The first, fourth and seventh times you use the card you get a free lift ticket, all other times you get $10 off (you are ahead quite a bit by the third day). These cards can be purchased on the hill (either Sunshine or Marmot Basin), or also at Safeway stores in Edmonton and Calgary, and are valid at Sunshine Village in Banff and Marmot Basin ski resort in Jasper. The Sunshine-Marmot cards are available for purchase until December 31 but can be used all season.
Louise Plus cards are very similar to Sunshine Marmot Cards. In addition to Lake Louise, they are also honored at four other ski areas: Castle (near Pincher Creek, Alberta); Revelstoke (Revelstoke, BC); Panorama (Panorama, BC), and Schweitzer (Sandpoint, Idaho, USA).
You can purchase a Tri-Area Pass for Sunshine Village, Lake Louise Mountain Resort and Norquay. This ticket includes the bus transportation and can be used at any of the three hills at any time.
Ski and snowboard rentals
There are a number of great places in the Town of Banff that will rent high quality skis, snowboards, and boots. Some will also rent winter coats and pants. All Banff National Park ski areas require skiers & snowboarders under age 18 to wear helmets. Adults will find that not only do helmets protect your head when you fall, but they do a great job of keeping your head warm in cold and windy weather.
14 Chateau Mountain Sports, 405 Spray Ave (Fairmont Banff Springs Convention Centre), ☏ +1 403-762-2500, info@chateaumountainsports.com. 8AM-8PM.

Other winter activities
Ice skating. There are outdoor skating rinks at the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel (fire, heated shelter) and at Banff Community High School (right next to Banff Avenue). A section of the Bow River is also cleared for skating. However, as always with bodies of natural ice, be careful. There is an indoor rink at Fenlands Banff Recreation Centre. Ice skates can be rented from some of the ski rental business.
Snowshoeing. Strap on snowshoes and walk through pristine snow like the fur traders did in days gone by, a true winter experience. Guided snowshoe walks are available, or you can rent snowshoes from some ski rental shops. Snowshoeing is subject to the same avalanche risks as cross-country skiing; check the current avalanche risk for your planned route with Parks Canada or at the website of the Canadian Avalanche Centre. In March 2014, four snowshoers were killed when they went into avalanche terrain near Lake Louise without proper training or equipment.

Summer in Banff, just like winter, is stunning. There are plenty of hiking trails accessible from the main town, as well as tours for horseback riding, white water rafting, mountain biking and more. Be warned though - some smaller tour companies are not as professional as the larger tour companies. If they are overbooked, they may pass your credit card details along to a third party without your knowledge and book another tour on your behalf (not always at the same price, and not always the same tour!)

Rock climbing. The area around Banff offers climbing for climbers of all levels — all climbs will happen with certified guides. Good places for beginners are Rundle Rock near the golf course and Yamnuska Bluffs and Zygote Crag. Advanced climbers should head to Wasootch Creek, Heart Creek and a site near Lake Louise.

Hiking and wildlife viewing
Banff has the most beautiful trails surrounding it. You can pick up a free trail map at the Visitor Centre, or find many trail maps online, as downloadable pdf files. Please check the trail reports online or with the Parks Canada desk before you go, as high-elevation snow, bear activity, or other factors may close trails or create hazards. Another option is to go with a hiking guide and group, different locations are available.
While in the area, always keep your eyes peeled as there are so many animals to spot in the summer in Banff. It is important to keep your distance, though, as wildlife is wild and they should be kept that way, they can be dangerous too! In the spring, female elk are very protective of their calves, who may lie hidden out of sight; in fall, bull elk are extremely aggressive during the rut. For this reason, you will need a telephoto lens to get good photos of wildlife while staying safe.
How can you tell that you are getting too close to wildlife? If the animal stares at you, moves away from you (even just a few steps), or behaves aggressively toward you, then you should back away until that behavior stops. Also, it is illegal to feed wildlife in a national park.
Visitors often confuse bighorn sheep with mountain goats. Goats are white with black noses and short black horns, and are usually seen high up on rocky ledges. Bighorn sheep are brown, with white rump patches and brown horns. They are usually seen by roadsides and grazing on grasses close to rocky outcrops. You'll never forget the difference after you watch this Parks Canada music video, "GOat Sheep GOat".
26 Sulphur Mountain Trail. Rather than taking the gondola up Sulphur Mountain, you can hike the trail up to the top of the ridge and catch the gondola down. (It's half price to just take the gondola down, but it's free before 10AM and after 7PM.) The trail is steep but manageable for those with a reasonable level of fitness. Note that there is a little-used road that goes down the side of Sulphur Mountain that is away from the town, which has been mistaken for the hiking trail; the road is much longer than the hiking trail. If you opt to hike down after taking the gondola up, you should be able to see the gondola towers and cables on your way down, as the hiking trail zigzags below the gondola lift. OSM directions edit
27 Tunnel Mountain Trail. A hike of 4.3 km, ranked as "easy". It starts from downtown Banff and takes you up the Tunnel Mountain, from where you have a nice view over the surroundings. You won't find any tunnel along the trail; when the Canadian Pacific railway was constructed in the late 19th century a plan was to build a tunnel through this mountain but it never happened. OSM directions edit
28 Fenland Trail. A very good spot for birdwatching all year, and you may also see beaver or muskrat in 40 Mile Creek. May be closed in spring due to calving elk. (Cow elk are very protective of calves.) OSM directions edit

Buy
Enjoy strolling alongside locals and world-travellers as you discover a cosmopolitan collection of galleries, boutiques and cafés. Shops range from internationally recognized clothiers or independently-owned establishments to Canada's oldest department store. A recommended way to experience the highlights is to start on Banff Avenue at the Cascade Plaza mall, do a quick circuit of the shops there, then head down Banff Avenue towards the Bow River. This is the retail, cafe, and restaurant heart of Banff. Once you get near the river, turn around and head back on the other side of Banff Avenue to complete the Banff shopping loop.
Eat
Banff is an exciting place to visit on all fronts, and the palate is not excluded. There are pubs, fast-food, fine dining, steakhouses (this is Alberta, after all!), traditional fare from around the world, and candy shops.
Banff can be an expensive place to dine as it is a tourist destination.
Alcoholic beverages: Visitors to Banff can sometimes be perplexed by Alberta's liquor laws. The legal drinking age in Alberta is 18. A restaurant that does not serve alcohol can admit diners of all ages. However, some restaurants that serve alcohol may be required to bar anyone under 18 from entering — even if they are just going to use the toilet. A second type of liquor licence allows both adults and minors to enter. To further confuse things, the same restaurant may be allowed to accept diners of all ages at certain times, but be open only to ages 18+ at other times of the day (usually evenings). All establishments that serve alcoholic beverages are legally required to have a food menu as well.
In a hotel, guests cannot take their unfinished alcoholic drinks from the hotel restaurant to their hotel room.
These are not rules imposed by management; they are legal requirements, and the business could forfeit their liquor licence if they are caught breaking them. Similarly, younger drinkers may have to show proof of age before they are served. Again, the business could lose their liquor licence if they are found serving under-aged patrons, so they need to be very careful.

Sleep
Being a national park, Banff has plenty of accommodation. However, book early, because places fill up quickly in winter and summer. To live in Banff, as opposed to being a perpetual tourist, residents must have a business in town. If you have access to a car, another often cheaper alternative is to stay in Canmore and drive to the ski resorts or into Banff.
Most hotels are along Banff Avenue or on Tunnel Mountain Road.

Stay safe
Banff has a lot of wildlife roaming in and around the town. Be careful of elk and deer when driving in the town. The most dangerous wildlife in Banff National Park are not bears or cougars, but elk. In spring, female (cow) elk are very protective of their offspring and will charge anyone who they consider a threat. In the fall, male (bull) elk are rutting and very aggressive. Cow elk weigh roughly 230 kg (507 lb), while bull elk weigh about 320 kg (705 lbs). Both sexes are capable of seriously injuring a person, and rutting males have also damaged cars.
Thirty years ago, bears used to be quite common within the town but conservation efforts have largely fixed this problem. Garbage and litter within the town must be discarded into bear-proof containers. In Banff National Park it is illegal to feed any wildlife, and both stupid and illegal to feed bears. "A fed bear is a dead bear": bears who learn to associate humans with food engage in behaviours that are threatening to humans and ultimately fatal to the bear.
Avalanches are a risk in winter. This risk is not limited to people engaging in activities like cross-country (Nordic) skiing, skiing off piste, ice climbing, or snowmobiling. The winter of 2013-2014 was particularly tragic in Banff National Park because four people were killed by an avalanche when snowshoeing and two people were killed by an avalanche when sledding. None of them had any avalanche gear with them.
Learn to identify avalanche hazards. An avalanche slope has enough of a slope to it that you can ski or sled down, but is not so steep that it won't hold snow. If you're not familiar with how to spot avalanche risks and you want to engage in outdoor activities like snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, or even sledding, check with Parks Canada staff or the Canadian Avalanche Centre for more information.
Be alert to your surroundings. Not all cliffs or other unsafe areas are marked with signs or blocked off by railings. Some travellers disregard railings and warning signs of unsafe terrain, when they exist, because they are keen on getting a closer look or taking photographs. Even if the risk is not obvious to you, it's best to assume that someone put up the barriers and safety messages for a good reason.
